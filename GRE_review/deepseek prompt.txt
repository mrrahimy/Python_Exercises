in this chat I want to use this grammar parts in your samples:
tenses (continues, perfect, present, future, passive), modals, conditional forms (0,1,2 and reverse), direct, indirect speech, countable and uncountable, wh words, relative pronouns and clauses (definitive and non- definitive), connective relative clauses, adjective/ participle clauses, noun clauses, adjectives, adverbs, so, such, too, enough, neither, either, still, yet, anymore, any longer, adverb clauses, so that, despite, in spite of, though, although, even though, furthermore, in addition, however
for the first word
give 3 advanced samples (grammar and vocab) for each word

use advanced and sophisticated academic vocabs in moderation
with Persian translation 
don't forget offer advance sentences- less common word and use scientific terms in moderation 
complex or compound sentences

at first of each sample tell me which grammar structures you used
give response as a json like this structure:
 {
  "examples": [
    {
      "word": "bellicose",
"pronunciation": {british: "asd", "USA":"asdasd"}
      "meaning": "warlike and inclined to quarrel",
      "examples": [
        {
          "grammar": ["present simple", "relative clause (definitive)", "adverb clause"],
          "english": "The bellicose leader, who thrives on conflict, has escalated tensions with neighboring countries, risking a full-scale war.",
          "persian": "رهبر جنگ‌طلب، که از درگیری لذت می‌برد، تنش‌ها با کشورهای همسایه را تشدید کرده و خطر جنگ تمام‌عیار را به وجود آورده است."
        },
